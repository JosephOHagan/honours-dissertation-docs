The following is a general outline of the development plan for what I’m considering to be the first project milestone (the Pre-Christmas milestone) as well as some preliminary notes for what I hope to accomplish over the Christmas break period. The goals for the Christmas break are to be finalised during the final sprint period of the first milestone.

The first two milestone dates are:
Pre-Christmas 	01/11/17 - 13/12/17 	(6 weeks)
Christmas  	13/12/17 - 11/01/18 	(4 weeks)

Estimated dates for the renaming milestones are:
January 	11/01/18 - 01/02/18	(3 weeks)
February 	01/02/18 - 01/03/18	(4 weeks)
March		01/03/18 - 22/03/18	(3 weeks)

Pre-Christmas Milestone Goal
Ideally I want it up on the asset store by end of January at the latest. 
	- This gives two months of feedback to tie into the evaluation section of the dissertation
	- It highlights bugs which can be fixed as new features are added via patches 
	- It can highlight flaws in the design which can be tweaked, streamlined and improved

The best time for submission to the Asset store is over the Christmas break as approval takes 14 days and you may be required to make changes to the application

Meaning I need a submittable core set of features developed by end of the Pre-Christmas milestone with either an approval and live product at the start of January or being given a list of changes to make with a revised approval live at the start of February

I’ll leave the features to implement slightly flexible and open to feature discover for now but I want the core set of interactions features that are needed for approval.

Additionally you want to end in a place were the more complex features are starting to take place and be experimented with. 
Using buttons as an example, it may implement horizontal and vertical buttons (simple buttons) Pre-Christmas and have some proof of concept (POC) work done for more complex buttons which are anchored to objects opposed to the world. 

A rough MoSCoW estimate would be as follows:

Must Have
Simple Buttons (horizontal & vertical)
Simple Drawers (there might not be any complex functionality but better to be conservative)
Object Interaction
Teleportation & Movement System
Controller Configuration When Interacting With Objects

Should Have
Loading Scene Transitions
Example Scenes For Asset Store Publication
Documentation For Asset Store Publication
Complex Buttons (proof of concept)
Complex Drawers (proof of concept)

Could Have
Leaver Interactions (pull based objects)
Doors Interactions 
Cupboard Interactions
Controller Button Mapping
Complex Buttons (implemented)
Complex Drawers (implemented)

Won’t Have This Time
[see other project requirements documents]

Note: This is subject to change
I might find that the button anchored to another object is more straightforward than I anticipate and choose to develop that over drawers for example
I might discover additional features which can be easily implemented to free up time later for the more complex features
Such changes will be documented and justified

Breaking this work into a rough estimate of three sprints (of two week durations per sprint) while leaving room for feature discovery and tasks taking longer than expected

Rough Time Estimates : 6 Week Milestone (2 week sprints)
Sprint 1 (01/11 - 15/11)
Additional background reading and planning
Simple object interaction
Simple movement and teleportation
Simple controller configuration
Simple buttons (time dependent)

Sprint 2 (15/11 - 29/11)
Simple buttons
Simple drawers
Any outstanding / complex variants of backlog or unfinished tasks
More complex object interactions
Feature discover tasks
Documentation for asset store
Preparation work for dedicated sprint 3 work (we don’t have classes so focus entirely on project)

Sprint 3 (29/11 - 13/12)
Finishing off outstanding tasks from above (if necessary)
Scene loading transitions
Example scenes creation for asset store
Documentation for asset store
Christmas break milestone planning


Christmas Break Goals
Remember that the lack of Vive might hinder the ability to test and develop some features easily

A collection of ideas towards the Christmas Break goals include:
- Start writing the dissertation: requirements section and note work on design / implementation sections
- Submit for publishing on asset store (finalising documentation for asset store and then submission)
- R&D work on more complex features such as automated testing
- Quick and simpler task work (small non-essential features which can be quickly implemented) 
- Additional example scene creation
