NOTE: Will transfer to a better formatted / spreadsheet(?) document at a later date. Will do for now.

01/10/17 1 hour: Repository and documentation setup and read project guide and assessement documentation. Thought about general ideas for project and what I'll need to do to get started / review / look into further. Setup Trello board.
