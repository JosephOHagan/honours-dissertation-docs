Newton Systems:
Door - Hinge Joint
Drawer - Configurable Joint
Lever - Hinge Joint
Twist Knob - Hinge Joint
Slider - Configurable Joint
Switch - Hinge Joint


Some default pull lever methods / button events
- Spawn an item
- Move a target
- Reset some
- Unlock a door

-> The idea here is to create some default event scripts (spawn an item, unlock a door, reset a scene, etc.) which can then be setup with the lever or button easily

Debugging Tool
-> Reset the scene from within the Unity instance
-> Turn on FPS counter and display VRTK style / on controller raycast menu

Doors
-> VRTK Style press button to make door swing open (old style games)
-> Pull on handle style (Newton)


How does it work
- You attach script to hand to make that interactive
- You attach a script to the base drawer, door, etc. and configure the points of motion via GameObjects
	- You could do something similar for doors with 2 points and then do some fancy math
