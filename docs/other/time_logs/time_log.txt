1 hour: Repository and documentation setup and read project guide and assessement documentation. Thought about general ideas for project and what I'll need to do to get started / review / look into further. Setup Trello board. Planned intial starting work / things to look into further.

02/10/17 
30 minutes: Setup of LaTeX and dissertation template - check compiles and formats correctly (it does though my LaTeX is rusty - may also setup build.xml similar to team project last year). Unity setup and borrowed an unloved copy of "C# Yellow Programming" book to skim through to "sharpen" those C# skills. Curated additional reading and viewing material for tomrrow. Updated meeting minutes with Friday's "meeting" notes from notebook.

1 hour 30 minutes: Spent time reading "The Yellow C# Book" to get familar with the language again because it has been a while and the work I did with it was very small. Read most of the first 3 chapters of the book. Hope to have what remains of chapter 3 and the remaining 2 finished by Thursday. Coded some simple example programs.

1 hour 30 minutes: Spent time researching VRTK and Unity itself. Found a handful of other links and resources to look into. I have a very rough idea of what VRTK is and how it works but will need to spend more time looking at it and Unity in general. Part of the project seems to be to solve the technical mess which I expect is using tools like VRTK is for certain tasks. Perhaps asking what's an example feature / task which I could simplify might be the way to start. 

In general though I expect the simplistic VR application would be to setup a plane to move / look around in. Setup some lighting for the space. Set off some particles preferably in the sky / skybox. Stand back and admire the particle fireworks.

That's right we're keeping this daily chain of work going however small the work might be. That's right at least 30 minutes of dissertation work everyday. Some days I hope to commit fully to it once the VR lab is setup and things are slightly more development focused.

2 hours: More C# work, read more of the textbook (I should have it finished before the weekend) and coded some more examples

20 minutes: Looked into additional Unity tutorial links and sorted the list of links to investigate

I didn't get a chance to look at Unity and the VR-side of it today despite wanting to. The general plan is to make some games in Unity whilst reading about the VR stuff, the VR tools and VR development as a whole. Well the "No I need to have game developer level knowledge of Unity for this project!" mentality is the justification I'm using on myself as an excuse to really learn Unity and VR development in depth.

Had meeting with Dr. Williamson for more of an overview and the plan of attack for the next two weeks [see meeting minutes for more detail]

30 minutes: Aside from the meeting I did a little more C# work and planned the goals and aims for the week ahead, call it a "retrospective", in that I went over the Trello board to see what I accomplished, didn't accomplish and what I think could be doing better.

I was going to do more but the football was on and you know when the match ends as it only can for Scotland...

06/10/17
30 minutes: Put together a list of things to research, etc. Started on requirements gathering question list. Sorted out recorder on phone to record interview.

07/10/17
30 minutes: I didn't get as much of a chance to work on the project today as I might have liked. Did a little research into the general process to release something on the Unity asset store. That is the end goal of the project. I also added more detail to the meeting notes having spent some time thinking about it and what I should be trying to achieve in the next 2 weeks.

I mean I had some developer talks about VR in general on in the background while I did my Functional Programming assessed exercise (I'm going to need to write more Haskell but that's a different problem) but I don't think that counts. Interesting though. I should make a list of those...

08/10/17
Scotland failed to qualify for the World Cup play offs with a level of disappointment only possible by the Scottish football team

30 minutes: Trello setup and general Unity research 

09/10/17
1 hour 30 minutes: Finished up that Yellow C# textbook but I'd like to spend a little more time looking at delegates in particular

1 hour 30 minutes: Worked on Unity tutorials.

It was my intention to do more but a plug decided to trip, overload, I don't know what, in the kitchen at my flat. Now I'm not an electrican but generally when the switch part of a plug is hot that's not a good sign. What makes it better is that it is literally sealed into kitchen tiles with grout. That'll be fun to get off. My flat mate panicked as if he's never been in a situation where something has gone wrong in a flat before. I just wanted to flip the fuse at the fusebox itself but I did the "responsible" thing and contacted my landlord first. Let the record show he did everything I intended to do. I've never had a plug get stuck in the ON position. That and the heat was the worrying part.

That took 2 hours of my life to deal with and it still won't be fixed until Friday.

10/10/17

3 hours: Finished up some Unity tutorials and experimented with repositories and Unity projects.

My landlord showed up prematurely to deal with the plug situation which ruled the evening's work out AGAIN. And he's still coming back to do more on Friday.

At least tomorrow and Thursday I should be able to focus fully on the project.

11/10/17

3 hours: Task planning for next week's work and general VR research. Had meeting with Dr. Williamson to discuss lab setup. Will meet again tomorrow at 14.30 to play with the Vive, I mean do very important and hard work and setup the Vive configuration with some Steam games and VR... VR
