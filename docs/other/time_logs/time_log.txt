[Put in place week starting 08/11/17]

Week Starting: 27/09/17 

Note: Weeks start on a Wednesday as that’s the day I have supervisor meetings

01/10/17 
1 hour: Repository and documentation setup and read project guide and assessment documentation. Thought about general ideas for project and what I'll need to do to get started / review / look into further. Setup Trello board. Planned initial starting work / things to look into further.

02/10/17 
30 minutes: Setup of LaTeX and dissertation template - check compiles and formats correctly (it does though my LaTeX is rusty - may also setup build.xml similar to team project last year). Unity setup and borrowed an unloved copy of "C# Yellow Programming" book to skim through to "sharpen" those C# skills. Curated additional reading and viewing material for tomorrow. Updated meeting minutes with Friday's "meeting" notes from notebook.

03/10/17
1 hour 30 minutes: Spent time reading "The Yellow C# Book" to get familiar with the language again because it has been a while and the work I did with it was very small. Read most of the first 3 chapters of the book. Hope to have what remains of chapter 3 and the remaining 2 finished by Thursday. Coded some simple example programs.

1 hour 30 minutes: Spent time researching VRTK and Unity itself. Found a handful of other links and resources to look into. I have a very rough idea of what VRTK is and how it works but will need to spend more time looking at it and Unity in general. Part of the project seems to be to solve the technical mess which I expect is using tools like VRTK is for certain tasks. Perhaps asking what's an example feature / task which I could simplify might be the way to start. 

In general though I expect the simplistic VR application would be to setup a plane to move / look around in. Set up some lighting for the space. Set off some particles preferably in the sky / skybox. Stand back and admire the particle fireworks.



Week Starting: 04/10/17

04/10/17
That's right we're keeping this daily chain of work going however small the work might be. That's right at least 30 minutes of dissertation work everyday. Some days I hope to commit fully to it once the VR lab is setup and things are slightly more development focused.

2 hours: More C# work, read more of the textbook (I should have it finished before the weekend) and coded some more examples

20 minutes: Looked into additional Unity tutorial links and sorted the list of links to investigate

I didn't get a chance to look at Unity and the VR-side of it today despite wanting to. The general plan is to make some games in Unity whilst reading about the VR stuff, the VR tools and VR development as a whole. Well the "No I need to have game developer level knowledge of Unity for this project!" mentality is the justification I'm using on myself as an excuse to really learn Unity and VR development in depth.

05/10/17
Had meeting with Dr. Williamson for more of an overview and the plan of attack for the next two weeks [see meeting minutes for more detail]

30 minutes: Aside from the meeting I did a little more C# work and planned the goals and aims for the week ahead, call it a "retrospective", in that I went over the Trello board to see what I accomplished, didn't accomplish and what I think could be doing better.

I was going to do more but the football was on and you know when the match ends as it only can for Scotland...

06/10/17
30 minutes: Put together a list of things to research, etc. Started on requirements gathering question list. Sorted out recorder on phone to record interview.

07/10/17
30 minutes: I didn't get as much of a chance to work on the project today as I might have liked. Did a little research into the general process to release something on the Unity asset store. That is the end goal of the project. I also added more detail to the meeting notes having spent some time thinking about it and what I should be trying to achieve in the next 2 weeks.

I mean I had some developer talks about VR in general on in the background while I did my Functional Programming assessed exercise (I'm going to need to write more Haskell but that's a different problem) but I don't think that counts. Interesting though. I should make a list of those...

08/10/17
Scotland failed to qualify for the World Cup play offs with a level of disappointment only possible by the Scottish football team

30 minutes: Trello setup and general Unity research 

09/10/17
1 hour 30 minutes: C# and its delegate system
Finished up that Yellow C# textbook but I'd like to spend a little more time looking at delegates in particular

1 hour 30 minutes: Worked on Unity tutorials.

10/10/17
3 hours: Finished up some Unity tutorials and experimented with repositories and Unity projects.



Week Starting: 11/10/17

11/10/17
3 hours: Supervisor meeting and general VR research
I did some general VR research background reading. It’s too interesting. I keep getting distracted reading about stuff like Asynchronous Spacewarp.

ASYNCHRONOUS SPACEWARP 

(I may have stolen the TL;DR: note system from an Oculus article on this very subject https://developer.oculus.com/blog/asynchronous-spacewarp/ -- TRADE SECRETS)

Also I had meeting with Dr. Williamson to discuss lab setup. Will meet again tomorrow at 14.30 to play with the Vive, I mean do very important and hard work and setup the Vive configuration with some Steam games and VR... VR

12/10/17
4 hours: Vive Orientation
Dr. Williamson showed us how to set up the Vive after which I proceeded to spend the afternoon playing Vive games and getting a feel for using it. There were some other students present but unfortunately they had to leave midway through our play session to go to a tutorial or something. I luckily didn’t have a class so was free to play with the Vive. I only managed to check out 3 of the games we have access to for the Vive: Tilt Brush, Waltz of the Wizard and Rec Room.

I wish I had my own VR room.

13/10/17

14/10/17
General Unity Development
I spent some more time just getting familiar with Unity and working through some simple non-VR Unity projects.

15/10/17
Amazon online interviews used up most of the day which I was hoping to use for work on the dissertation.

16/10/17
Unity SteamVR Development - Hello World
I made a simple example "Hello World" application for the Vive using Unity and SteamVR. It's the most basic example where you can  

17/10/17
C# Development
I spent some time looking into aspects of C# which I’ve yet to get familiar with. Threading to be specific. There’s a recommended resource on it so I’m working my way through it.

VRTK Development - Hello World
I went through some simple tutorials on VRTK to make recreate the "Hello World" style of application I made using pure SteamVR. As VRTK is code free but chaotic I was also able to add some object highlighting when you hover over the item to pick up and a basic teleportation movement system. My initial impressions of VRTK is that although it handles a lot of the coding for you it still requires a lot of technical setup that's VRTK specific. Also the lead developer's accent in his overview videos is that strong Birmingham whine that just gets under your skin.

 
Week Starting: 18/10/17

18/10/17
Meeting and Scene Loading
One of the problems Dr. Williamson highlighted in today’s meeting was the problem of scene loading. After the meeting I took a shot at creating an example of the effect that they experienced. I managed to get transitions between scenes working and I went to the interim area though I have no idea to fix that. It’s a good idea though so will need to explore again after some background reading.

19/10/17
Event Handling & Object Interaction Research
I did some general reading into the Unity event system and object interaction. I spent a lot of time thinking about picking up objects in VR. When you pick up an item does your hand become the item or does the controller remain present? If the item cannot go through a wall should your controller ghost through it? Should your controller be a physical object or transparent ghost-like outline? There’s a lot to think about in regards to controllers.

20/10/17
Unity SteamVR Development - Hello World Projectiles
I made an extended version of the SteamVR Hello World box pick up example. Now when you pick up the box and press the triggers on the controllers it starts firing spheres.


21/10/17
Custom Inspectors & Windows Research
I did some general reading into the development of custom inspectors and windows for Unity. I took a look at the VRTK GUI design and wow… 
Actually sitting down and looking at its layout and design it’s certainly something.
I attempted to make a simple example custom inspector but it was going nowhere so I looked out a better resource to follow along and called it a day

22/10/17
Button Example
I made a simple button example using pure SteamVR which when the button is pressed triggers some timer event. This timer event could of course be substituted for some other event such as spawning a box or unlocking a door.
What’s next I’m thinking is to recreate a similar example using VRTK (and I’m thinking it’s time to dive properly into NetwonVR) and compare and contrast the methods. I’ll take a look for other methods of implementation as well.

23/10/17
Custom Inspector Example
I made a simple custom inspector example to change the material colour of some object. It’s a simple but it explains the basics of creating a custom inspector and providing the user with information through labels and text. I still need to do a custom editor window at some point though I’ve found a resource which should allow me to make a similar customer editor window.

24/10/17
NewtonVR research
I spent some time reading up on NewtonVR in more detail now that VR development does seems as intimidating. In particular I was interested in what VR developers prefer using it for over VRTK. 
In general the feedback is quite mixed in that some people much prefer the physics system (I might be one of them). It also has some nice additional features such as the sound-collision framework built-in for easy use by the developer

Week Starting: 25/10/17

25/10/17
2 hours: Debbie & Dennis code review meeting
Today I met Debbie and Dennis for a “client meeting” type of interaction. I recorded the meeting for reference purposes (though the audio isn’t the greatest). Before we sat down and did a “code review” style of exercise where they experienced project PTSD and highlighted all the key areas they struggled during development, I got the chance to enter and play around with the Intern experience they created. You could see some of the bugs and issues they experienced during development such as the ghosting of items into other items and the irregular functioning drawers. During the meeting I asked questions, though Debbie and Dennis were great as they answered a lot of questions before I even got a chance to ask them. The plan now is to take that audio recording, write up a general transcript style of document with notes and write up a more formal set of requirements for the project.

26/10/17
1 hour: Meeting transcribing
Spent some time starting to write up the meeting. This is going to take some time. The general approach right now is to listen to a small section and then write up a general overview of what was discussed. Typically I add a few comments and notes regarding and expanding on what was said. Occasionally when I have a feature or example scene idea I outline that.

27/10/17
2 hours: Meeting transcription
Spent some more time writing up the meeting. Its pretty much finished entirely now though it will require tidying up and further refinement. 

28/10/17

29/10/17
1 hour: Editor Window example
I implemented an editor window example which changes the colour of materials of objects. It's very similar to the custom inspector example that I did except that it is its own window opposed to being tacked onto the inspector window. I’ll probably have to look at these some more.

30/10/17
2 hours: Initial requirements planning & development strategy work
I spent some time thinking about the release strategy for the project - when the project should roughly first go live on the Unity Asset store in order to maximise 

31/10/17
BOO!



Week Starting: 01/11/17

01/11/17
2 hours: State Machines & Meeting
I spent some time thinking about the concept and use of state machines in game development. I hadn’t actually done this before. It’s a very interesting idea. State machines are cool. I spoke with Dr. Williamson about Dr. John Williamson’s C# state machine that he made. A “developer’s state machine” is what she called it. Pure. It would be nice to get that into the project though I fear time may not be on my side. Actually scrap that. State machine is going in. 

02/11/17
1 hour: Unity Library Creation Research
I spent some time trying to find the additional steps required in Unity library creation as suggested by Dr. Williamson. I did find a few things though will need to spend some more time looking into this topic. 

03/11/17
04/11/17

05/11/17
Requirements Refinement - MoSCoW Style
I parsed through the Debbie & Dennis meeting notes properly and wrote up a rough set of MoSCoW requirements. I have that problem of “Well let’s just do everything” though I think I’ve managed to get a decent set together. I’ve left it loose enough so that additional requirements may be planted and grow. They might be in place of or in addition to some of the existing ones.  I’ll need to reformat the rough development plan which I created though to account for this more concrete set of requirements.

06/11/17
Requirements Refinement - Non-Functional / MoSCoW
I spent a little time finishing off the MoSCoW requirements document and working on some non-functional requirements. Those might be a bit harder to do. I’ll need to 

07/11/17
GUI Design
I spent some time looking into GUI and interface design to make my interface user friendly opposed to other systems (VRTK) which are so dense and cumbersome that they are overwhelming to new and non-technical developers. I’m kind of playing the role of Apple in this project. Sure it does a lot of what the competition does and it’s only got a few unique and new ideas but it just look how easy and straightforward it is to make this drawer work. 

Started sorting examples and notes
My desktop, notes and examples organisation currently look like the Central Bureaucracy from Futurama. 



Week Starting: 08/11/17

08/11/17
1 hour: Requirements refinement & repository organisation
Collected notes and example demos for sorting, additional requirements refinement and planned repository structure.

1 hour 30 minutes: Fixed the time log
Maybe don’t forget to commit time log changes and have different parts of it scattered about in different files. At least the lesson was learned early. Also it gave me an opportunity to restructure the format to make it human readable. A similar thing happened with the meeting minutes earlier in the project now that I think about it. Well I never make the same mistake thrice. I’ll reorganise the Trello page and make it public later today as well.

The general “time log style sheet” I hope to hit is:
TIME SPENT: TL;DR SUMMARY
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

30 minutes: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DON'T KNOW ABOUT
Richard Feynman as a graduate student when faced with preparing for his second year oral examinations opened a fresh notebook and on the title page wrote: NOTEBOOK OF THINGS I DON’T KNOW ABOUT. Today I opened a notebook, titled similarly, and began the process of deconstructing and decompiling everything I don't know about VR and game development.

09/11/17
1 hour: Repository and note organisation
I spent some time continuing to get the repository into order. I set up two separate respositorys which act as a project index. One is for VR development while the other is for general game development and has a Unity section. Both contain a list of related examples and applications which I created to learn Unity, VR development, etc. I also started collecting the various notes and projects that I have together. I forgot that I broke a lot of the example applications which I made while playing around with things. I'll fix the broken ones and get them onto a separate repo / added to the index.

10/11/17 & 11/11/17
I didn't work on the dissertation today. 
I blitzed through a computer architecture assessed exercise.
I decided that I should also probably start preparing for a job interview at Amazon on the 17th.

12/11/17
1 hour: VRTK interaction mapping overview
I spent an hour going through my original VRTK example making notes of the different steps involved in making an object interactable, adding highlighting on hover and setting up teleportation. Some of the steps aren't as jarring or complex the second time around though they attempt to cram a lot into a single step which I think overcomplicates some tasks. It may be a lack of documentation, explanation or the poorly design GUI component. I'll need to take another look at this in some more detail and plan a POC according. 

Making a simple VR POC seems unlikely for this week. What I might do instead is make a non-VR POC (that is take one of the existing examples that I made and add a GUI component to change and alter some of its aspects). I have a simple graph animation visualisation thing which could be a candidate for that.

1 hour: Unity physics research
I spent some time looking to the Unity physics system again. As this forms basis for how the joints and colliders work, which I anticipate will feature heavily in the pre-Christmas development work, I think it best to get a good understanding of how they operate and work. 

13/11/17
30 minutes: VRTK interaction mapping & background reading
I spent some more time looking at the interaction system used in the VRTK example.

30 minutes: Graph Animation POC
I spent some time cleaning up and preparing the graph visualisation before turning it into a POC with additional editor windows. 

14/11/17
1 hour: Spent time refining the development plan in light of forgetting to account for course work

1 hour: Unity Joints and Colliders
I spent some time looking over and investigating Unity joints and colliders again. Made a simple example using hinge joint. I'm not entirely sure yet if it will be better to use a hinge joint or to make a my own using the customisable joint yet. Perhaps the best course of action there will be to POC both and see which works better and is more customisable. Perhaps including a simple door and customisable door might be useful. That is the simple door is very limited from a development standpoint but the customisable door is a lot more flexible though requires additional setup and work from the user.

1 hour: Started a design note folder and started investigation into streamlining initial project setup

Weekly Time Estimate (Hours) : 10-12 (I should aim for more)


Week Starting: 15/11/17

Note: I'm in London on 16/11 and 17/11 for an Amazon job interview
Note: The weekend was spent catching up on coursework and working on assessed exercises
Note: Next week should be full force on the dissertation (except for lectures of course)

2 hours : Object Auto Snap
Job Simulator has this auto snap for objects. That is you get the object in rather close proximity to the object and then it will highlight where the object will snap to that location. You could expand it so that the object floats, hovers and rotates into place but an auto snap for now will suffice. I made a little example application proof-of-concept style of thing and took a look at how VRTK does it. I'll need to look into it some more but I should be able to get it implemented and will aim to do so before Christmas.

21/11/17
3 hours : Vive Controller Management and Handling
I spent some time investigating button mapping and getting input from the contollers. I made a simple example where you can pick up a cube and move a cube around in the air through interaction with the controller.

After that I investigated assigning "controller events" to a controller. That is upon pressing a button on the controller to trigger some event, etc. Things like that. I also spent some time considering different methods of managing the controllers as a whole within my application. VRTK uses an SDK manager where you setup controller aliases within the manager for cross compatibility with different HMD devices. I might adopt a similar structure for my own project to future proof the system as a means of managing the controllers as a whole within the project.


Weekly Time Estimate (Hours) : 5 (Will make up for it next week)

30/11/17
Dr. Williamson meeting 
I discussed potential architectures during the supervisor meeting but will need to settle on one within the next few coming days. I'll spend some time in the next 3 days to experiment with implementing different systems and settle on the system I'll be using going forward. 

01/12 | 02/12 | 03/12
Architecture Design
I spent some time drawing out both the architectures used by VRTK and Newton and then different architectures I could implement. I ended up with 3 different potential models. The first most closely resembles the VRTK model, the second the Newton model and the third is takes aspects from both but is mostly of my own design. I then spent some time implementing the core of each of the three models. Of the three I will go forward with my own. I believe that my own model is a better fit for the general philosophy and idea of what the SteamVR Assistant (SVRA) intends to be. The SVRA acts the parent for a collection of sub-toolkits which each focus on streamlining an improving a different aspect of Vive development. You might already like NetwonVR physics but find testing and debugging to be a problem so you can just use that aspect of the SVRA toolkit.
