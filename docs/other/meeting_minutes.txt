29/09/17: Supervisor "Meeting" / Chat
Approached Dr. Williamson during a 3rd year lab as due to the hectic academic style life she missed my email to organise a meeting. Originally I was  going to send an email during the weekend but learned she happened to be running a lab at the same time I too was in the Boyd Orr. Took a chance in going direct to the source. It seemed to work.

Dr. Williamson gave a brief overview of the aims of the project. I'll be working with Debbie and Dennis (http://dennisanddebbie.club/) who'll serve as the client role. Debbie is the more technical of the two and Dennis the artist. Dr. Williamson said we'll need to mine them for requirements (as is the software engineering way)

I'll need to think about what I'll have to ask them. Their current work flow and development tools, how they imagine feature X and Y, etc. Dr. Williamson can probably help with that or at the very least ensure I don't forget to ask something completely obvious.

Project though is to develop toolkit which requires little to none technical experience. 

Current VR toolkits are apparently poorly documented and a technical nightmare for artists (Dr. Williamson had to reverse engineer one of them in order get something working)

She said I can probably take a look at some code / work which she has done previously to get a general idea of what I'm up against.

My project is to change that and make a toolkit that is easily usable by non-technical developers. 

Spoke briefly about some things I can do in preparation of our next meeting. She recommended three existing libraries (VRTK, Newton VR, SteamVR) to take a look at as well in addition to taking a general look at Unity and C#. I've a little experience with C# and Unity but will need a refresher on that. Wait I should make Word Scrumble in Unity as a refresher!

Dr. Williamson went over the key things to do before our next meeting - setup GitHub repo, meeting minutes and other documentation, setup dissertation template and suitable link dump for the dissertation. Do some general ready of existing tools and start playing with Unity & C#. 

She also mentioned that Unity projects and GitHub repos can be troublesome to work with at times. It won't be too bad as I'm the lone developer but I should play around with that beforehand.

They have Vives and Gear VRs though the project description stated aimed at mobile devices.

Anyway John Carmack is currently working on Gear VR and if John Carmack deems something important enough to be actively working on it then that's justification enough.

THEY ARE SETTING UP A VR LAB WITHIN THE SCHOOL.

That is rad.

Scheduled our first "proper" meeting for Thursday October 5th 2.30pm

05/10/17: Proper Supervisor Meeting

Note: We setup a regular meeting for Wednesday 2.30pm

Went over what I've done thus far in preparation. We also went over the key goals of the project once more in some more detail.

The VR lab has yet to be setup, academics are busy people, but they hope to have it setup within the next week. Book out time slots, etc. It's going to have a Vive!

Using Vive might have an effect on making some games in VR and other side effects - use the SteamVR camera. It will also be worth looking into SteamVR more as well and reading up on that. I wonder if there was a Steam Dev Days talk on it? Surely...

I'll need to find out what exactly I need it for and what can be done outside of the VR lab as I imagine a lot can.

General project overview:

As has been covered the general idea of the project is to make VR development as non-technical developer friendly as possible. No coding required if possible. Drag and drop this script here and your set.

Essentially despite tools like VRTK claiming to be user friendly and easy to use they still use a lot of Unity terminology, require lots of configuration to get up and running and often a lot of digging into code to get things running. That's not artist friendly. 

Newton VR was apparently HORRIBLE in that regard to work with for Dr. Williamson and D&D. The code base is supposedly a mess. Also they had multiple versions of the project working concurrently where a feature was implemented in on and tested to make sure everything was still working and if it was then transfer it over to the main project.

Let's simplify that process to require as little technical input from the artists as possible. Ideally no coding would be required on their part. Instead of configuring multiple things how about we configure or set it up once and all that other work is taken care of on the back end. How about we just drag and drop a pre-made script and that setups up the feature that we want. Dragging and dropping scripts, user a user interface, stuff like that.

Now the technical purists might scream at this statement but think of it as automatically setting up an item with a pre-established default (which I've determined). If they want more control then dig into the code and change the gravity variable value or whatever it is they want to change. But let's follow that idea of making it as code free as possible to setup the scene or desired feature with this pre-established default set of values and settings.

Example: Think about enabling the player's jump in a video game. Now in Halo the gravity set for the players jump is different and more floaty / moon-like than the gravity on the other objects in the game. Now the default "enable gravity" setting for an object would be your standard item in the game world which if enabled for the player would give them that gravity. For more VR experiments a single gravity setting is probably fine but should creator wish to alter the player's gravity then they can by changing the code.

That's a bit of stretch as an example but I used it in a conversation about the idea of configuring a default item gravity today so I've reused it.

So we're hiding all that config from the user and just giving them a default setup of "Here's your item setup to work with in this VR environment". It's less customisable but its sold and it works everytime. There's none of the one-off issues you might face where something just doesn't work because of the order you configure the items or because some other item is configure in a certain way, etc.

I do all the heavy lifting on the backend and provide a nice, clean, well designed UI to work with on the front end. 

The general plan for the next two weeks though is as follows:

2 weeks time have a requirements gathering session thingy with Debbie & Dennis:
	- Record the interview / chat and turn that into a plan for development
	- Get them to go through a code walkthrough so they can point and go "HATED THAT PART", etc.
	- Questions like "Can you give an example of a task you would want simplified", "What's the current process", etc.
	- Ask D&D what they want streamlined (it'll probably be dev-heavy but that's great because it looks and is more impressive!)

In the meantime familarisation, research and get some practical VR development experience - get Hello World in VR up and running. 

I liked the idea of make a fireworks show but a Hello World in VR really should include something you can pick up and throw at a wall or the ground. Ideally it won't go through either. Of course there will be physics associated with the item. And it would be really cool if it made a noise on collision. Stuff like that.

Keep up the C#, Unity and VR development swatting, make a few Unity games and figure out that repo situation.

Another key thing to look into is the sound / audio library. VRTK might not have this and the one in Newton didn't work at all for Dr. Williamson's project. 

That can also be a key part of the project. 

I'll need to look into that some more but it sounds feasible, at least the simple case of attaching a sound file for the ball to make noise when it collides can't be that hard.

My Question: Regarding an example of a task to simplify
Answer: This was answered pretty much before I got the chance to ask but it again highlights the non-developer nature of the project. 
For example to add one item might require configuring like 5 different things and then you still fall through portions of the floor. Let's simplify that to a few clicks, drag a script here and it's set. None of this configure A, B, C, oh and D is broken so configure P, Q, R, etc. configure once if at all. 

-- Things to do in preparation:
1. Start preparing questions for what I'll ask D&D at the interview meeting
2. Hello World in VR with existing toolkits to see just how technical this VR development business is
3. Investigate sound library thingy
4. Investigate
