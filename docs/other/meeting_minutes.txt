29/09/17: Supervisor "Meeting" / Chat
Approached Dr. Williamson during a 3rd year lab as due to the hectic academic style life she missed my email to organise a meeting. Originally I was  going to send an email during the weekend but learned she happened to be running a lab at the same time I too was in the Boyd Orr. Took a chance in going direct to the source. It seemed to work.

Dr. Williamson gave a brief overview of the aims of the project. I'll be working with Debbie and Dennis (http://dennisanddebbie.club/) who'll serve as the client role. Debbie is the more technical of the two and Dennis the artist. Dr. Williamson said we'll need to mine them for requirements (as is the software engineering way)

I'll need to think about what I'll have to ask them. Their current work flow and development tools, how they imagine feature X and Y, etc. Dr. Williamson can probably help with that or at the very least ensure I don't forget to ask something completely obvious.

Project though is to develop toolkit which requires little to none technical experience. 

Current VR toolkits are apparently poorly documented and a technical nightmare for artists (Dr. Williamson had to reverse engineer one of them in order get something working)

She said I can probably take a look at some code / work which she has done previously to get a general idea of what I'm up against.

My project is to change that and make a toolkit that is easily usable by non-technical developers. 

Spoke briefly about some things I can do in preparation of our next meeting. She recommended three existing libraries (VRTK, Newton VR, SteamVR) to take a look at as well in addition to taking a general look at Unity and C#. I've a little experience with C# and Unity but will need a refresher on that. Wait I should make Word Scrumble in Unity as a refresher!

Dr. Williamson went over the key things to do before our next meeting - setup GitHub repo, meeting minutes and other documentation, setup dissertation template and suitable link dump for the dissertation. Do some general ready of existing tools and start playing with Unity & C#. 

She also mentioned that Unity projects and GitHub repos can be troublesome to work with at times. It won't be too bad as I'm the lone developer but I should play around with that beforehand.

They have Vives and Gear VRs though the project description stated aimed at mobile devices.

Anyway John Carmack is currently working on Gear VR and if John Carmack deems something important enough to be actively working on it then that's justification enough.

THEY ARE SETTING UP A VR LAB WITHIN THE SCHOOL.

That is rad.

Scheduled our first "proper" meeting for Thursday October 5th 2.30pm
