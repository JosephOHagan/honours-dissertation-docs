# VR Development Toolkit
The aim of this project is to build a virtual reality development toolkit aimed at non-technical developers working with the HTC Vive headset.

The Unity platform (https://unity3d.com/) makes it possible to create complex environments using a graphical user interface, but many of the more advanced features are difficult to implement without extensive programming experience.

This project aims to develop a Unity VR library suitable for artists, with little to no technical knowledge, interested in developing VR content by creating a range of tools which can be used through Unity's graphical editing tools.
